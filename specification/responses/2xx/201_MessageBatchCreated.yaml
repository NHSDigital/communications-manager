  Your message batch has been created. The backend service will process the messages contained within it according to the routing plan identified in the request.

  The response includes an array with your `messageReference` and our message `id` for each message in your request.
  You should store these IDs so that you can later query the message status using the [Get the status of a message](#get-/v1/messages/-messageId-) endpoint.
