  You have made too many requests too quickly, you must send requests at a slower rate.

  If you have a retry mechanism in your HTTP client you may want to look at implementing an [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) or you can use the `Retry-After` response header to determine when you should retry your request.

  ### Sandbox

  It is possible to trigger this on the sandbox by using the `Prefer` header with a value of `code=429`.

  Here is an example curl request to trigger a `429`:

  ```
    curl -X GET --header "Prefer: code=429" https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/
  ```
