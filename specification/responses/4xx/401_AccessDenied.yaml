  Your request was not authorized - you need to send a `Authorization` header with a valid `Bearer` token.

  See the documentation on [how to generate a valid token](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication).

  ### Sandbox

  It is possible to trigger this error in the sandbox by sending the header `Prefer` with a value of `code=401`.

  Here is an example curl request to trigger a `401`:

  ```
    curl -X GET \
      --header "Accept: */*" \
      --header "Prefer: code=401" \
      https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/
  ```
