  There has been a client side issue reading your request. This can occur when there are networking issues between your application and our service.

  There may also be an issue within our backend where a `408` has been bubbled up and exposed.

  This could be indicative of an ongoing infrastructure issue that is out of our (or your) control.

  ### Sandbox

  It is possible to simulate this error response by sending a request with a header of `Prefer` set to the value `code=408`.

  Here is an example curl request to simulate this response:

  ```
    curl -X GET --header "Prefer: code=408" https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/
  ```
