  ### Sandbox

  On sandbox it is possible to simulate a 404 not found error using the `Prefer` header with a value of `code=404`.

  Here is an example curl request to trigger a `404`:

  ```
    curl -X GET \
      --header "Accept: */*" \
      --header "Content-type: application/vnd.api+json" \
      --header "Prefer: code=404" \
      https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms
  ```
content:
  application/vnd.api+json:
    schema:
      $ref: ../../../schemas/responses/errors/NotFound.yaml
  application/json:
    schema:
      $ref: ../../../schemas/responses/errors/NotFound.yaml
headers:
  $ref: ../../../snippets/StandardResponseHeaders.yaml
