  This endpoint is currently receiving a high volume of requests and is being rate limited.

  If you have a retry mechanism in your HTTP client you may want to look at implementing an [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).

  ### Sandbox

  It is possible to trigger this on the sandbox by using the `Prefer` header with a value of `code=429`.

  Here is an example curl request to trigger a `429`:

  ```
    curl -X GET --header "Prefer: code=429" https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/
  ```
