  The routing plan identifier passed in the body has not been found.

  When you [onboarded](#overview--onboarding) onto the service a number of valid routing plan identifiers were issued to you. You must use one of these valid routing plan identifiers when requesting for a batch of messages to be sent.

  ### Sandbox

  On the sandbox environment there are 5 valid routing plan identifiers that can be used by anybody calling the API. These are:

  * `b838b13c-f98c-4def-93f0-515d4e4f4ee1`
  * `49e43b98-70cb-47a9-a55e-fe70c9a6f77c`
  * `b402cd20-b62a-4357-8e02-2952959531c8`
  * `936e9d45-15de-4a95-bb36-ae163c33ae53`
  * `9ba00d23-cd6f-4aca-8688-00abc85a7980`

  If you use a routing plan id that is not in this list then a `404 Not Found` error response will be triggered.

  On other environments these values will be established as part of your [NHS Notify Service onboarding](#overview--onboarding).

  Here is an example curl request to trigger a `404`:

  ```
    curl -X POST \
      --header "Accept: */*" \
      --header "Content-type: application/vnd.api+json" \
      -d '{"data": {"type": "MessageBatch","attributes": {"routingPlanId": "868796f9-7ce3-4730-9f1e-23aa766edea3","messageBatchReference": "da0b1495-c7cb-468c-9d81-07dee089d728","messages": [{"messageReference": "703b8008-545d-4a04-bb90-1f2946ce1575","recipient": {"nhsNumber": "9990548609","dateOfBirth": "1932-01-06"},"personalisation": {}}]}}}' \
