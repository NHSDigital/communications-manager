  There is an issue communicating to our backend services. If this occurs it is a good idea to back off and retry the request at a later time - see the [Circuit Breaker pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/reliability/circuit-breaker.html).

  This error can occur if there is an issue with a dependent service and so may be bubbled up from a 3rd party HTTP call.

  ### Sandbox

  It is possible to simulate this error response by sending a request with a header of `Prefer` set to the value `code=504`.

  Here is an example curl request to simulate this response:

  ```
    curl -X GET --header "Prefer: code=504" https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/
  ```

  To simulate a backend `504` exception bubbling upwards you can send this request:

  ```
    curl -X GET https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/_timeout_504
  ```
