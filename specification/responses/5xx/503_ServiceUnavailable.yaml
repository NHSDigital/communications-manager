  ### Sandbox

  It is possible to simulate this error response by sending a request with a header of `Prefer` set to the value `code=503`.

  Here is an example curl request to simulate this response:

  ```
    curl -X GET --header "Prefer: code=503" https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/
  ```
