  An error has occured that is stopping your request from being processed. These errors may be thrown while the system is still being configured for your use, or a misconfiguration has occurred.

  The following errors can occur:

  | Error code | Title | Description |
  | ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
  | `CM_MISSING_ROUTING_PLAN_TEMPLATE` | Templates missing | The templates required to use the routing plan were not found. |
  | `CM_ROUTING_PLAN_DUPLICATE_TEMPLATES` | Duplicate templates | The routing plan specified contains duplicate templates. |
  | `CM_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | Error processing request | There was an internal error whilst processing this request. |

  Within each error is a source object which details the location of the error within your request body.

  Certain errors may include an extra set of metadata to assist you with resolving the problem.

  This is done using a pointer that uses the [JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) as per the [JSON:API Error Specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#errors).

  ### Sandbox

  It is possible to simulate these errors by sending requests with specific routing plan identifiers.

  To trigger the `CM_MISSING_ROUTING_PLAN_TEMPLATE` error use routing plan id `c8857ccf-06ec-483f-9b3a-7fc732d9ad48` or `aeb16ab8-cb9c-4d23-92e9-87c78119175c`. Here is an example curl request to simulate the response:

  ```
    curl -X POST \
      --header "Accept: */*" \
      --header "Content-type: application/vnd.api+json" \
      -d '{"data": {"type": "Message","attributes": {"routingPlanId": "c8857ccf-06ec-483f-9b3a-7fc732d9ad48","messageReference": "da0b1495-c7cb-468c-9d81-07dee089d728","recipient": {"nhsNumber": "9990548609","dateOfBirth": "1982-03-17"},"personalisation": {}}}}' \
      https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/v1/messages
  ```

  To trigger the `CM_ROUTING_PLAN_DUPLICATE_TEMPLATES` error use routing plan id `a3a4e55d-7a21-45a6-9286-8eb595c872a8`. Here is an example curl request to simulate the response:

  ```
    curl -X POST \
      --header "Accept: */*" \
      --header "Content-type: application/vnd.api+json" \
      -d '{"data": {"type": "Message","attributes": {"routingPlanId": "a3a4e55d-7a21-45a6-9286-8eb595c872a8","messageReference": "da0b1495-c7cb-468c-9d81-07dee089d728","recipient": {"nhsNumber": "9990548609","dateOfBirth": "1982-03-17"},"personalisation": {}}}}' \
      https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/v1/messages
  ```

  It is possible to trigger the `CM_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` on the sandbox by using the `Prefer` header with a value of `code=500`.

  Here is an example curl request to trigger a `500`:

  ```
    curl -X GET --header "Prefer: code=500" https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/comms/
  ```
