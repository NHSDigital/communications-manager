## Overview

Use this endpoint to get details of patients registered with the NHS App for a given GP surgery, and an indication of whether they have enabled push notifications on one or more devices. The response will only include patients who have had their identity verified to the high (P9) level.

This information can be used by client applications to determine whether it is appropriate to attempt to use the NHS App channel to send in-app messages and push notifications to patients, or if alternative communication channels should be used instead.

The information provided by this endpoint is generated by a daily batch process. Client applications should cache and refresh local copies of this data accordingly.

## Pagination

To avoid returning excessively large response bodies, the results may be split across multiple pages. On retrieving the response for the first page of results, the Response body will contain links to the current page, the next page and the last page. If there are further pages, these can be retrieved by making additional request(s) with the page parameter specified.
