# 404 Tests

These tests target the API endpoint GET /v1/messages/{messageId} testing that 404 is returned when messageId does not exist


## Scenario: An API consumer submitting a request to an unknown endpoint receives a 404 ‘Not Found’ response

**Given** the API consumer does not know how to identify the resource they want to fetch
<br/>
**When** the request is submitted to an unknown resource
<br/>
**Then** the service responds with a 404 not found response, telling the user the resource does not exist
<br/>

**Asserts**
- Response returns a 404 ‘Not Found’ error
- Response returns the expected error message body
- Response returns the ‘X-Correlation-Id’ header if provided

**Correlation IDs**

This test uses the ‘X-Correlation-Id’ header, when provided in a request it is returned in the response.
