# 400 Tests

These tests target the API endpoint GET /channels/nhsapp/account testing that 400 is returned when the ODS code is missing or invalid


## Scenario: An API consumer submitting a GET NHS App Accounts request without an ODS Code

**Given** the API consumer sends a request to get NHS App Accounts without providing an ODS Code
<br/>
**When** the request is submitted
<br/>
**Then** the service responds with a 400 invalid response, telling the user the ODS Code is missing
<br/>

**Asserts**
- Response returns a 400 ‘Invalid’ error
- Response returns the expected error message body
- Response returns the ‘X-Correlation-Id’ header if provided

**Methods**

This test makes use of different HTTP methods, if the method is either HEAD or OPTIONS the test will not assert against the body of the response as none is returned.

| GET     |

**Correlation IDs**
