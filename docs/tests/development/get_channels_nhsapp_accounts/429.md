# 429 Tests

These tests target the API endpoint GET /channels/nhsapp/accounts testing that 429 is returned when the BE has reached a quota limit with the NHS App API


## Scenario: An API consumer submitting a request when the backend service responds with a 429 Too Many Requests error

**Given** the backend service is unable to call a downstream service because the quota has been reached
<br/>
**When** the request is submitted
<br/>
**Then** the response is a 429 Too Many Requests error
<br/>

**Asserts**
- Response returns a 429 Too Many Requests error
- Response returns the expected error message body
- Response returns the ‘X-Correlation-Id’ header if provided

**Correlation IDs**

This test uses the ‘X-Correlation-Id’ header, when provided in a request it is returned in the response.
